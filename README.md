# HuffmanEncoding

## About this project
This Huffman encoding was implemented for the ECM141 Data Structures and Algorithms Course.

## Built With
This project was built with [Java Ver: 15.0.2](https://www.oracle.com/hk/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) using the IDE [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

## Getting Started
1. Please paste your text you want copied to the root of the project folder
* Or you could copy the contents of your text you want compressed to the existing text.txt file
3. From the project folder please run main within HuffmanEncoding.java class
4. Interact with the terminal window for the project
5. Follow the instructions printed in the terminal screen

(note:)
  You will be able to see the compressed file after your first compression found within the main project folder labeled as "output_file.bin"
